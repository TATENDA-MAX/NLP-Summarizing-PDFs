            " Jacob R. Holm, Daniel S. Hain, Roman Jurowetzki & Edward Lorenz (2023) In this paper, we discuss the impact of artificial intelligence on innovation dynamics . We argue that AI has affected innovation dynamics in at least two distinct ways . We also discuss the merits of AI as a general purpose technology and argue that conclusions about AI in relation to innovation dynamics are likely to change when AI is widely adopted .  Rapid advances in machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) have enabled AI to penetrate various industries and automate tasks that were once solely dependent on human intelligence . The impact of AI goes beyond simply automating discrete tasks; it also extends to the innovative alteration of existing processes and the introduction of entirely new tasks .  AI can also be an output  of innovation dynamics when used as a tool in innovation . This AI output can translate into process innovations in other firms and thus affect a range of processes, such as process automation, data-driven decision-making, employee and customer management and the innovation process .  The papers in the SI further our knowledge in several of these areas . They variously present analyses of the difficulties associated with data access and collaboration when developing new AI solutions (Woolley 2023) and the challenges faced by adopters (Taherizadeh and Beaudry)  Four papers present case studies in which AI is also used as a tool in research and development . One paper discusses how AI coupled with blockchain technology systems can be used to facilitate collaboration for innovation between competitors . The proposed solution is the implementation of federated machine learning (FML)  In some papers, AI is a technology that firms can adopt as a process of innovation . In others, it is a tool in the innovation process used in the development stages to write code, simulate virtual prototypes and so on . We discuss three themes that are prominent in recent research on AI and innovation .  The definition of AI used by Petruzzelli et al. (2023) may appear to be narrower than those used by the other authors . The papers in this SI advance this debate . The general finding that AI has broad implications for organisations’ learning capabil­��ities, collaboration patterns and innovation processes is consistent .  The key point is that, given the wide potential  use of prediction, AI does have GPT-like characteristics and could have a major impact  on the whole economy . This distinguishes AI from GPTs such as electricity or the internet, which are common infrastructures utilised for diverse activities .  When AI is used in the innovation process, data plays a central role (Cillo and Verona 2022; Varian 2019) If AI is equated with ML and is used as an input or a tool in the innovation process, then data and AI are complementary inputs or assets . Including data in innovation process creates new tasks and concerns about topics  such as bias, ethics, the economic value of data and data sharing .  Studies by Lepratte and Yoguel, Woolley and Taherizadeh and Beaudry (2023) and Woolley show how AI with FML can help transform interfirm collaboration for innovation to the extent that FML allows firms to collaborate on the development of an ML model without sharing their data on a centralised platform .  Most research on AI focuses on AI as a technology that replaces skilled employees . This is an under-addressed issue in research focusing on the impacts of AI . The link between information processing and decentralised organisational design is crucial when using AI to enhance employees’ skills .  The impact of using AI in this manner on the skills of employees at different levels of the hierarchy remains ambiguous in the literature on AI . The issue is that tasks connected to decision-making cannot be automated or even separated from the decision itself . Decision-making gen­ishly remains decentralised, and AI is instead deployed as a tool at the various decision  points .  Studies were conducted to investigate the changes occurring in innovation dynamics in the age of AI without preconceived notions of such changes . The papers presented in this SI focus on two key topics. The changing nature of collaboration for innovation is discussed . With data playing a central role in the training of AI, collaboration becomes both necessary and difficult . The other key topic is the internal organisational impact that results  from the use of AI .  The SI was written between 2021 and 2023, a period of rapid technological change within the field of AI . The use of AI also challenges the legitimacy of individuals as AI can be used to assist in decision-making . The timing of this SI can be considered both a limitation and an opportunity for further research on generative AI .  Advances in transfer learning (i.e. retraining of a model to perform a new task) and transfer learning are reshaping the ML data landscape . The adoption of generative AI is likely to result in a shift in innovation dynamics that is potentially very different from the adoption of predictive AI .\n",
